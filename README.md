# Journal-Rank
Journal-Rank


WIP website for reviewing academic journals. When finished will allow users to submit opinion reviews for academic journals.
Far from complete, but the WIP project can be set up on Linux by:

1. Cloning repo.
2. Installing requirements `$pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Setting Flask environment variable: `$export FLASK_APP=journal-rank.py`
4. Running the Flask app `$flask run`
