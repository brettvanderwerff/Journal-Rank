# Journal-Rank
Journal-Rank


Work-in-progress website for reviewing academic journals. When finished will allow users to submit opinion reviews for academic journals.
Far from complete, but does have basic, very unpolished functionality now. The WIP project can be set up on Linux by:

1. Cloning repo.
2. Installing requirements `$pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Setting Flask environment variable: `$export FLASK_APP=journal-rank.py`
4. Running the Flask app `$flask run`

With which you should see the landing page:
