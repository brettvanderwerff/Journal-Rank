                        Journal-Rank is a place for readers/authors of academic journals to publish opinion based reviews
                        of the journals they read/submit to. There are many measures of journal ranking via analysis of metrics like citation/
                        publication count etc., but as far as I can tell no place for users to submit opinion based reviews so I made Journal-Rank to address that.
